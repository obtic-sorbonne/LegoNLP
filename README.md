# LegoNLP for DH
This notebook is a toolbox designed for researchers, teachers, and students in the humanities and social sciences who wish to work with data using machine learning and NLP. 
It is organized as a processing pipeline with various stages, ranging from data acquisition, cleaning, and conversion to advanced features such as text generation and comparison, as well as information extraction and text statistics.

The blocks in this notebook are independent yet complementary.

Enjoy using it, and feel free to share any feedback or suggestions with us!
